## Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple implementation of the famous Tic Tac Toe's Game using Python

## How it works
The grid contains 9 spaces to receive an input. The game grid must receive coordinates according with the following matrix values:
(1,1)|(1,2)|(1,3)
-----------------
(2,1)|(2,2)|(2,3)
-----------------
(3,1)|(3,2)|(3,3)
1)Each user must enter a coordinate, going from (1 1) 'till (3 3), one at a time
2)The first person to enter coordinates will be Player 1 which will be the 'X'
3)The second person to enter coordinates will be Player 2 wich will be the 'O'
4)Whoever completes a sequence of 'X' or 'O' in a line / column / diagonal first, wins!


## What's next
- Improvements  on the source code
- An Interface will be add to make the game more interactive
